Tester-Haskell
===============

A bizarre, pointless test-running suite that comes with an internal DSL for specifying which tests should be run.

**This project is not serious and never really was.  I did it to learn stuff.  Notice the lack of tests and flee!**

For an example of how something like this might be used, [the Scala version of this library](https://github.com/TheBizzle/Tester) being used in my [AStar](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding) project (specifically, [here](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding/blob/master/AStar/src/test/org/bizzle/astar/BiDirAStarTest.scala)).
